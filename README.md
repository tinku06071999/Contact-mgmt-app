# Contact Management App with Charts and Maps

This is a contact management app built using ReactJS, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, React Router v6, and Axios. The app provides a dashboard with charts and maps to visualize COVID-19 data.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a simple dashboard with the following features:

- A line graph showing the fluctuations in COVID-19 cases worldwide.
- A React Leaflet map displaying markers for different countries. Each marker indicates the country name, total number of active cases, recovered cases, and deaths. This information is shown as a popup when the marker is clicked.

## APIs

To fetch data and create the dashboards, the following APIs are used:

- World wide data of cases: [https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/all](https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/all)
- Country-specific data of cases: [https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/countries](https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/countries)
- Graph data for cases with date: [https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/historical/all?lastdays=all](https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/historical/all?lastdays=all)
